Conditional Prob Review P.2

P(A|B) = P(A)
and
P(B|A) = P(B)

if both are true that A,B is independent

if P(A n B) = P(A) * P(B)
then, A and B are independent

P(A|B) = P(A)
then , P(A) = P(A n B) / P(B)
then, P(A) * P(B) = P(A n B)
this is how you get the equation above this one
this can only be done if A and B are independent.

Real basic conditional prob stuff
like there are 500 people surveyed, 222 male and 278 female
They choose between 3 shoes to like the most
For the wire 102 male and 80 female
For the Sopranos 70 male and 110 female
For Sex and the City 50 male and 88 female
    1. Given that they are female what is the chance of them liking sopranos
            Answer: 110/278
    2. Given that their fav show is Sopranos what is the chance they are female
            Answer: 110/180
Now, divide each number by the total number of people surveyed.

Now 

            Male    Female  
The Wire    0.204   0.16    0.364
Sopranos    0.14    0.22    0.36
Sex City    0.1     0.176   0.276
            0.444   0.556   1

The above table is called the joint distribution
each number is the proportion of people under certain conditions
like at point The Wire, Female is the proportion of people who like The Wire and are Female is 0.16

The right most column is th emarginal probability distribution

With this graph you can also ask questions like
    1. What is the probability of a person being male OR favoring Sex and The City
            Answer: P(Male OR SexCity) =    Add up all male probs and all Sex & and the City Prob (no double counting)
                                            0.444 + 0.176
                                            0.62
P(Male OR SexCity) = P(Male U SexCity)
= P(A) + P(B) - P(A n B)

So all this condenses into two formulas

if A and B are independent 
    1. P(A n B) = P(A) * P(B)

2. P(A U B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A n B)

The final situation is when A and B are mutually exclusive
P(A|B) = 0
P(B|A) = 0
Chance of one happening after the other is 0
    Example:    You threw an even # on a single die
                You threw an odd # on a single die
                These can not happen at the same time
P(A n B) = 0

mutual exclusion indicates each event being complements
so (Even)c = Odd
(Head)c = Tails

P(A) = P(A n B) + P(A n Bc)
Either event can be decomposed into two parts as shown above
P(A n B) = what A and B share
P(A n Bc) = what is both A and outside of B or !B

This can be further decomposed
P(A n B) = P(A|B) * P(B)
P(A n Bc) = P(A|Bc) * P(Bc)
To then get
P(A) = P(A|B) * P(B) + P(A|Bc) * P(Bc)

Now we can extract this to have many events and not just 2
So lets say there is event B and events A1-A5 that may or may not have pieces of B within them.

P(B) = P(B|A1) * P(A1) + ... + P(B|A5) * P(A5) = the summation from i = 1 to 5 of P(B|Ai) * P(Ai)

Bayes' theorem
we know P(A|B) = P(A n B) / P(B) or P(A|B) * P(B) = P(A n B)
Similarly, P(B|A) = P(B n A)/P(A) or P(B|A) * P(A) = P(B n A)
P(A n B) = P(B n A)
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B) 
^ is the mathematical statement of Bayes' theorem

Bayes's theorem is useful because we get the relationship between A and B
        Example:    You take a test for covid P(t+|C) = .99   //t+|C = sensitivity
                    That statement indicates the sensitivity of the test based on if you have covid
                    so the test 99% of the time catches that you have covid 
                    On the other side P(t-|!C) = .9           //t-|!C = specificity
                    this means that if you dont have covid 90% of the time it will say that
