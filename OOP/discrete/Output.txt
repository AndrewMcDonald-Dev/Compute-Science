When comparing e(n) to the "best case" (constant) and the "worst case" (2^n)
the program does not end any clean way. It lands on an "inbetween" amount.
The average for e(n)/2^n is about 0.138 which clearly places it way above the 
n case and way below the 2^n case. Another quirk that is identified with this
data is that generally, as n increases the e(n)/2^n decreases. It is unkown 
whether this trend continues or fades off logorithmically. Unfortunately, this
program is seemingly either inefficient or the numbers trying to be calculated
are throttled because whenever my device tried to calculate above n = 30 the
time needed to do each level was noticebly exponential. It toke about 15 mins
for my computer to get to the n = 40 case after the n = 35 case. I choose to 
cut the data there because going any further would have taken an extraordinarily
long time.
